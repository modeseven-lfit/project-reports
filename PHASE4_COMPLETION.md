## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

### 1. Complete DataAggregator Class Implementation

- **`aggregate_global_data()`** - Master orchestrator for all aggregation operations
- **`compute_author_rollups()`** - Merges author metrics across repositories by email
- **`compute_org_rollups()`** - Groups authors by email domain with metric aggregation
- **`rank_entities()`** - Deterministic sorting with nested key support and tie-breaking

**Core Aggregation Pipeline:**

```python
# Repository Classification
active_repos = repos where days_since_last_commit <= activity_threshold_days
inactive_repos = repos where days_since_last_commit > activity_threshold_days

# Age Distribution Buckets
very_old = inactive_repos where age > very_old_years (default: 3)
old = inactive_repos where old_years < age <= very_old_years (default: 1-3)
recent_inactive = inactive_repos where age <= old_years
```

### 2. Advanced Author Aggregation Engine

- **Cross-Repository Merge** - Combines author data by email address across all repositories
- **Metric Summation** - Adds commits, lines added/removed/net across time windows
- **Repository Tracking** - Counts unique repositories touched per author per time window
- **Identity Normalization** - Handles email case sensitivity and username extraction

**Author Rollup Logic:**

```python
# For each author email across all repositories:
author_aggregates[email]["commits"][window] += repo_author["commits"][window]
author_aggregates[email]["repositories_touched"][window].add(repo_name)
author_aggregates[email]["lines_net"][window] += repo_author["lines_net"][window]
```

### 3. Organization-Level Analytics

- **Domain Extraction** - Groups authors by email domain (e.g., @example.com)
- **Contributor Counting** - Tracks unique contributors per organization
- **Metric Aggregation** - Sums commits and lines of code across domain contributors
- **Repository Footprint** - Estimates organizational repository involvement

**Organization Aggregation:**

```python
org_aggregates[domain]["contributors"].add(author_email)
org_aggregates[domain]["commits"][window] += author_commits[window]
org_aggregates[domain]["contributor_count"] = len(unique_contributors)
```

### 4. Intelligent Repository Ranking

- **Activity Classification** - Uses configurable `activity_threshold_days` (default: 365)
- **Multiple Ranking Metrics** - Supports commits, lines of code, repository age
- **Top/Bottom Lists** - Configurable limits for top active and least active repositories
- **Comprehensive Repository Data** - Includes full metrics in rankings for context

### 5. Sophisticated Leaderboard System

- **Multiple Leaderboard Types:**
  - `top_contributors_commits` - Ranked by commit count in primary window (last_365_days)
  - `top_contributors_loc` - Ranked by net lines of code in primary window
  - `top_organizations` - Ranked by organizational commit activity
- **Configurable Limits** - `top_n_repos` setting controls leaderboard sizes
- **Rich Contributor Profiles** - Full metrics included for each ranked entity

### 6. Deterministic Sorting Algorithm

- **Primary Sort Key** - Configurable metric (supports nested keys like "commits.last_365_days")
- **Secondary Sort Key** - Alphabetical by name/domain/email for tie-breaking
- **Nested Key Support** - Handles complex data structures with dot notation
- **Stable Results** - Consistent ranking across multiple runs

**Sorting Implementation:**

```python
# Primary metric (descending) + secondary name (ascending) for stability
if reverse:
    sorted_entities = sorted(entities, key=lambda x: (-get_sort_value(x), get_name(x)))
else:
    sorted_entities = sorted(entities, key=lambda x: (get_sort_value(x), get_name(x)))
```

## 🔧 Advanced Aggregation Features

### Cross-Repository Author Merging

- **Email-Based Identity** - Merges same author across multiple repositories
- **Metric Accumulation** - Sums commits and lines across all author's repositories
- **Repository Footprint** - Tracks unique repositories touched per time window
- **First-Wins Name Resolution** - Uses first encountered name/username for consistency

### Multi-Level Aggregation Hierarchy

```
Individual Commits (Phase 2)
    ↓
Repository-Level Author Metrics (Phase 2)
    ↓
Global Author Rollups (Phase 4)
    ↓
Organization Aggregations (Phase 4)
    ↓
Leaderboards & Rankings (Phase 4)
```

### Configurable Age Distribution

- **Very Old Repositories** - `age > very_old_years` (default: 3 years)
- **Old Repositories** - `old_years < age <= very_old_years` (default: 1-3 years)
- **Recent Inactive** - `age <= old_years` but still inactive (default: <= 1 year)
- **Dynamic Thresholds** - Fully configurable via `age_buckets` configuration

### Smart Ranking Algorithm

- **Nested Key Support** - Handles "commits.last_365_days" style sort keys
- **Null Value Handling** - Gracefully handles missing metrics (defaults to 0)
- **Multiple Entity Types** - Works for repositories, authors, and organizations
- **Limit Enforcement** - Respects top_n limits while preserving sort order
