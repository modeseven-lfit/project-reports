# This file defines exceptions for organizational domain extraction.
# By default, organizations are identified by the last two parts of an email
# domain (e.g., "users.noreply.github.com" becomes "github.com").
#
# Some domains require special handling where more than two parts are needed
# to properly identify the organization.

# Domains that should be preserved in their full form (no truncation to last
# 2 parts)
preserve_full_domain:
  - "zte.com.cn"  # Chinese domain where all 3 parts are needed for proper ID

# Custom domain mappings (optional - for future use)
# If you need to map specific domains to different organizational names
custom_mappings: {}

# Settings
settings:
  # Whether to apply organizational domain extraction at all
  enable_organizational_grouping: true

  # Default behavior for unknown/unspecified domains
  # Options: "last_two_parts", "preserve_full"
  default_extraction_method: "last_two_parts"

  # Domains to ignore completely (contributors from these domains won't be
  # grouped)
  ignore_domains:
    - "unknown"
    - "localhost"
    - ""
